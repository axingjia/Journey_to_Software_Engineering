There are many books needed to be read relating to Software Engineering. The "Object-Oriented Software Engineering" by Lethbridge, "Software Engineering" by Sommerville,  the "Object-Oriented Software Engineering" by Bruegge, and "Software Requirement" by Wiegers, and "Professional Software Engineering" by Mcconnel.

All of them are required or recommended materials for some university courses at SFU. Should I do it?

With this much time spent, I could do many things. It might be a test to see if someone is serious about software engineering. Hopefully it's just all soft theory and nothing too dense.

Without further ado,let the learning begin :)
